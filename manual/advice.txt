Advice
It is next to impossible to debug your parser by entering grammar rules for the whole language
and then starting to test it. Instead, you should adopt an incremental approach. Enter the
rules for a few grammar productions at a time and test them. When you are convinced that
they work, add some more productions an repeat the testing process.
From a practical perspective, it makes sense to begin with the productions for the ex-
pression grammar. Once your parser is handling expressions correctly, add assignment, then
statement lists. You can then expand to the control-flow and I/O statements, declarations,
and, eventually, the entire langauge.
